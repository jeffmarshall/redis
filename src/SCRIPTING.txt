TODO:

    MULTI/EXEC/...: should we do more than simply ignoring it?

    Prevent Lua from calling itself with redis("eval",...)

    Implement log() function, and define REDIS_WARNING, REDIS_NOTICE, ...

    SCRIPT FLUSH or alike to start a fresh interpreter.

    Max exection time for scripts, even pretty high, but in order to
    prevent that an instance gets completely freezed by error.
    Hint: Use a debug hook for this (lua_sethook() with LUA_MASKCOUNT).

Blog post TODO:

    Explain that for now this is just an experiemnt and there is no way to
    tell if this will ever enter Redis stable, but that since it is pretty
    self contained it is trivial to rebase with the unstable branch.

    Explain how replication / AOF mix with scripting and why it is this way,
    and that scripts should be written to don't depend from timing or other
    external events if you want to use AOF / replication.

    Show how fast it is!

    Mention that dynamically generated scripts are not a good idea.
